# Junior Frontend Developer Portfolio - Bootstrap 5.3

Remade my previous portfolio using Bootstrap's components and utilities. The site is also responsive using Bootstrap's grid system, thus needing fewer media queries to achieve the same desired effect.

## Application Appearance

## Fixed Bug

Initially, I included the Bootstrap syntax `d-flex` to the navbar collapse toggle, as I thought I needed this to adjust my nav links to the right. Instead, it was stopping my navbar from collapsing. This has now been removed and the navbar toggle is working as intended.
